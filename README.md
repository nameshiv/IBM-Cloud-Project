*Project Description:*


# Problem Statement:-   
Design a machine learning model to detect and classify different types 
of faults in a power distribution system. Using electrical measurement data (e.g., 
voltage and current phasors), the model should be able to distinguish between 
normal operating conditions and various fault conditions (such as line-to-ground, 
line-to-line, or three-phase faults). The objective is to enable rapid and accurate fault 
identification, which is crucial for maintaining power grid stability and reliability. 

# Proposed Solution:-
The system addresses the challenge of fault classification in power distribution using machine learning.  
Key components include:    

Data Collection: Voltage and current phasors under normal and fault conditions from substations or simulations.  

Preprocessing: Data cleaning and feature engineering.  

ML Model: Classification model (e.g., Random Forest) trained on electrical parameters and external factors like weather.  

Deployment: Hosted on IBM Cloud Lite, using Watson Studio and Watson Machine Learning.  

Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score metrics.
